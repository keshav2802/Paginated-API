# Paginated API

An implementation of a paginated API on a MongoDB database.

# Description

Pagination is the ability to return just a subset of the result from a server or an API to the client. With the help of pagination we can return to the user just a limited number of results at a time and the user can do a page forward or a page backward to get the rest of the results same as google search results work. I have created a paginated system which can be used to fetch data from a MongoDB database with the help of an API.

# Tech used

* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
